# Clutch Drive

Low-poly chibi football: characters built in Blender, played in the browser with Three.js / React Three Fiber.
You're trailing late in the 4th with the clock running. Call the plays and win it with a touchdown.

- **Daily Drive** (`/play?mode=daily`): the same scenario and same play outcomes for everyone each day, with a Wordle-style emoji result to share.
- **Survivor** (`/play?mode=survivor`): win to stay alive; each game gets harder. Best streak is saved.
- **Practice** (`/play?mode=practice`): pick any two of the 32 teams and run drives as often as you like.
- **Locker Room** (`/locker`): every animation in any uniform.

The name lives in `src/brand.js`, so a rename is a one-line change.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

- In a game, call one of four plays:
  - **Quick Out**: a short throw to the slot, who steps out of bounds to stop the clock (6–9 yards).
  - **Dig**: a safe pass to WR1 over the middle (usually 14–23 yards).
  - **Deep Shot**: boom or bust to WR2 on a go route (about half fall incomplete; completions go for 35+).
  - **HB Dive**: a handoff up the A gap (2–7 yards).
  - Outcomes are seeded, so each snap plays out differently. There are broken tackles, pass breakups, overthrows, touchdowns and runs out of bounds. **Replay** re-runs the same play in slow motion with a close-up camera.
- **Clock rules:** incompletions and runs out of bounds stop the clock. If you're tackled in bounds, the clock runs in real time while you pick the next play, with a minimum 8 seconds to line up. Timeouts stop it.

Team names and colors are approximations, with no logos. Fan-made, not affiliated with the NFL.

## Character pipeline

`blender/build_player.py` builds the whole character from code: mesh, rig, and all animation clips.
It exports `public/models/player.glb` (~310 KB, mostly animation data) and saves `blender/player.blend` so you can open it and edit by hand.

```bash
npm run model           # rebuild the GLB after changing the script
npm run model:preview   # also render PNG previews to blender/preview/
```

- **Clips:** Idle, Stance, Run, Block, Throw, Catch, Dive, Fall, Celebrate (30 fps).
- **Team colors:** materials named `Jersey`, `Pants`, `Helmet`, `Stripe`, `Socks`, `Glove` and `Skin` get recolored per team in `src/three/characters.js`.
- **Posing:** the script measures each bone's axes, so poses are written as plain *swing / spread / twist* degrees. Feet stay flat automatically, and every pose is auto-grounded so nobody sinks into the turf.
- **Hand-made art later:** if you model a nicer character in Blender, keep the same bone names, action names and material names. The game will load it with no code changes.

## Deploy

Live at **https://clutch-drive.vercel.app**. The Vercel project is connected to this GitHub repo, so every push to `main` deploys to production automatically (other branches get preview URLs).
It's a static Vite build; `vercel.json` rewrites every route to `index.html`. `.env.production` sets `VITE_SITE_URL` so the social preview image link is absolute.

Manual deploy, if ever needed: `npx vercel deploy --prod`.

## Code map

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `src/pages/Landing.jsx`, `src/scenes/HeroScene.jsx` | Landing page with a live 3D hero of today's matchup |
| `src/pages/Game.jsx`, `src/ui/GameUI.jsx` | Game flow (intro → call → play → result → game over), scorebug, play cards, banners, share |
| `src/game/drive.js` | Drive rules: clock, downs, field position, score, daily/survivor scenarios, share text |
| `src/data/nflTeams.js` | 32 teams: city, name, abbreviation, uniform colors (jersey, helmet, stripe, pants, socks, numbers, end zone) |
| `src/three/characters.js` | Loads and clones the rig, applies toon materials, uniforms and jersey numbers, `Animator` (crossfading clip player) |
| `src/sim/playSim.js` | Play calls, roles, routes, coverage, blocking, ball flight, catches, breakups, tackles. Seeded and fixed-step, so replays are exact. Units are yards; offense drives toward +z |
| `src/scenes/PlayScene.jsx` | Steps the sim at 60 Hz, applies it to the 3D players, and runs the ball, broadcast/replay cameras and crowd reactions |
| `src/components/Stadium.jsx` | Stands, instanced crowd in team colors (cheers via the vertex shader), goalposts, light towers, sky |
| `src/scenes/ViewerScene.jsx` | Character / animation viewer |
| `src/components/Field.jsx` | Field drawn onto a canvas texture (yard lines, hashes, numbers, end zones) |

## Dev helpers

- In dev builds, `window.__sim` is the live sim. `__sim.camMode = 'close'` switches to a replay-style close-up camera; `__sim.timeScale = 0.25` gives slow motion.
- `window.__advance(seconds)` steps the play and renders synchronously.
- `node scripts/capture.mjs <dir> <w> <h> [broadcast|close] [dig|deep|run] [seed]` saves headless screenshots through a play (needs `npm run dev` running and Google Chrome installed).
- `node scripts/e2e.mjs <dir> <w> <h> [daily|survivor|practice] [plays]` plays a full drive by clicking the real UI and screenshots each step.
- `node scripts/make-assets.mjs` regenerates `public/og.png` (social card) and the PNG app icons.
- `node scripts/check-errors.mjs [path]` loads a page and prints any errors.
- `node scripts/outcomes.mjs [seeds]` simulates every play call across many seeds and prints the yardage spread, for balance tuning.
- `node scripts/capture-viewer.mjs <dir>` does the same for the Characters viewer.
